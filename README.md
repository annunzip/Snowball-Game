# Snowball Game
The Snowball Game, designed in Unity and C#, is a first person shooter of sorts where the player can fire snowballs to try and defeat the hordes of snowmen chasing them. The goal of the game is to get through all three levels while avoiding capture to save Christmas. There are powerups and extra snowballs the player can pick up throughout the levels to help them to the end. Touching the star at the end of each stage is the way to progress. (For a fun mechanic, you can aim straight down and fire while jumping to get a good bit of height, just be careful that you don't run out of snowballs, leaving you defenseless) 

## Installation:
This game is for unity version 5.3.1, so to run it, open the project in that version and hit play. As a warning, it might take a little while to load due to the sheer number of assets in the game. 

## What I did for this game:
For this game, I designed all the levels with unity assets, programmed the player's firing mechanic, and also programmed the snowman enemies. The snowman enemies also have a firing mechanic, and are programmed to chase the player. I also helped design and implement the powerups for snowball refills and damage up, as well as the mechanic where the player touches a star at the end of each stage to progress. Lastly, I helped implement the boss fight in the last stage (the boss's attacks, his health bar, and the win screen for beating him)
